# Python-Projects
These are some interesting projects implemented in python modified from various implementations.

1. Invisibility Cloak:
   * If in the hues value figure if the colour you want appers only once in a fixed range then create only one mask.
     for eg: for yellow colour, make only one mask with upper and lower limit as (25-30)
   * The output may come pixelated and some of the other features may get replaced due to bad lighting and/or 
     poor selection of the cloth. (Select matte finish cloth without reflection.)
     
1. Real Time Face Detection
   * Used face_recognition model which is a pretrained model available in python modules. You can install it by : pip3 install face_recognition
   * Used open cv just for capturing the live feed and display the result in live . You can just use the model and input an image.
